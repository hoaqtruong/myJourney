//******************* DISPLAY IMAGES (TABLE)*********************//
Display table size is class /helpers/folder.php line 37
To change the table size, set parameter in instance of class folder:
For example:
Default is $height = '200px', $width = '160px' - this should be the size of the size of pics in the images/.../.../thumbs
Right now the thumbs are in different format and size,

******To do: standardize thumbs images
( I haven't done this b/c I want to create new design for my website which could show pictures in full-screen)

To make border of the thumbs display table: uncomment line 22 .gallery li {} in css/gallery.css
