<h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
<p>Beside using HTML and CSS with PHP like on the website you are looking at, I also apply CSS with ActionScript.<br/>
    For example, all assets of <a href="http://localhost:8888/?v=computer_skills&s=Flash_and_ActionScript">this IChing Flash game</a>,
    are dynamically generated by ActionScript - not by Flash. The assets are styled with CSS:
    <a href="https://github.com/hoaqtruong/IChingGame/blob/master/app/GameStyleSheet.as">codes on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3>PHP: Self-learning</h3>
<p>After the two PHP classes in 2009 and 2010, to practice and to extend my programing skills in PHP,
I worked on converting the MVC album app, the final projects of the classes, into my personal website.
To serve the purpose of displaying my personal works, I developed this website as both file-based and databased MVC object oriented framework;
and added the following functions to the app:</p>
<p>As a file-based app, it can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read folders [recursively], select specific file types, and display in html format dynamically. <a href="https://github.com/hoaqtruong/myJourney/blob/master/helpers/folder.php">Codes on Github</a></li>
            <li>Display image using ColorBox - a JavaScript framework.</li>
            <li>Paginate long content. <a href="https://github.com/hoaqtruong/myJourney/blob/master/helpers/pagination.php">Codes on Github</a></li>
        </ul>
<p>As a database oriented app, it can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Connect with the database. <a href="https://github.com/hoaqtruong/myJourney/blob/master/helpers/database.php">Codes on Github</a></li>
            <li>Format uploading data, and perform CRUD. <a href="https://github.com/hoaqtruong/myJourney/blob/master/helpers/artworks.php">Codes on Github</a></li>
            <li>Sign-up and Sign-in user. <a href="https://github.com/hoaqtruong/myJourney/blob/master/helpers/user.php">Codes on Github</a></li>
            <li>Session control. <a href="https://github.com/hoaqtruong/myJourney/blob/master/helpers/session.php">Codes on Github</a></li>
        </ul>
<p class="notation">(Since I installed a Wordpress app in parallel, there is no functional need to deploy the databased functions to this self-made site.)</p>
