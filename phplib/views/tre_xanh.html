<p>I solely created and conducted this program for a psycho-educational group focusing on clients who have issues with
    self-assurance and socializing skills, for a mental health clinic in San Francisco (RAMS). The group was open for
    new members to join in at any session. The group-size fluctuated from 5 to 10 participants.</p>
<h3>Objectives of the program:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Participant is able to reflect on an actual situation experienced during the week and to verbalize his or her
            sense of self through the experience.</li>
        <li>Participant discusses one social skill each weeks and meets with group peer(s) outside of the clinic settings
            once a month.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also conducted a research on the participants' usage of the internet and out-of-town phone communications during the program.</p>

        (Due to a mix of language capacity of the participants, most of the materials were in both Vietnamese and English;
        but only one version is presented below (some PDF presentations were converted from PowerPoint files).<caption/>
